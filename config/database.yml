# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
#production:
#  <<: *default
#  database: ebdb #<%= ENV['RDS_DB_NAME'] %>
#  username: ebroot #<%= ENV['RDS_USERNAME'] %>
#  password: password #<%= ENV['RDS_PASSWORD'] %>
#  host: aau2r385jhjw5q.c7uotqbqapu4.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com #<%= ENV['RDS_HOSTNAME'] %>
#  port: 3306
#   #<%= ENV['RDS_PORT'] %>
